      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Enforcement procedure</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’). If you’re not
        happy with how we respond to your complaint,

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Technical information about this service’s accessibility</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">Companies House is committed to making its service accessible in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This service is partially compliant with the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1</a>
        AA standard, due to the non-compliance shown below.</p>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Skip to content links</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">On some screens, the skip to content links do not show enough colour contrast. This may cause issues for users with some types of visual impairment. This does not meet WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.3 Contrast (Minimum). This
        will be fixed by the end of 2021.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we tested this service</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We regularly carry out internal tests for compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines V2.1 level A and level AA using a variety of manual and automated testing tools.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">This service was last (externally) audited on 28 July 2021. The audit was carried out by the
        <a href="https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/">Digital Accessibility Centre</a>. They tested all the screens from start page to confirmation of submission.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">To improve service accessibility, we:
      </p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
