      <h3 id="what-a-beneficial-owner-is" class="govuk-heading-m">What a PSC is</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">A PSC stands for ‘person with significant control’ and is someone who owns or controls a company. A company can have one or more PSCs.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">A beneficial owner does not have the same definition as a PSC. The requirement to report discrepancies is based on the Companies Act definition of a PSC.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body call-to-action">Read about
        <a href="#" class="govuk-link">how to identify PSCs of companies and limited liability partnerships (LLPs)</a>
        and
        <a href="#" class="govuk-link">how to identify PSCs of Scottish qualifying partnerships</a>.</p>

      <h3 id="what-a-discrepancy-is" class="govuk-heading-m">What a discrepancy is</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">A discrepancy is when the information that an obliged entity holds about a beneficial owner clearly shows that the information recorded by Companies House, in terms of the definition of a PSC, is incorrect.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">A discrepancy exists when a relevant entity has information that clearly indicates that the PSC information recorded by Companies House is inaccurate.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">This could include a discrepancy in the PSC's:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>name</li>
        <li>nature of control</li>
        <li>date of birth</li>
        <li>nationality</li>
        <li>correspondence address</li>
        <li>notified date</li>
        <li>place of residence</li>      
      </ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">Our focus is on factual errors, such as a missing PSC or an incorrect correspondence address, not typing mistakes. It is not a discrepancy when the entity holds information that we do not include on the PSC register.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">A spelling error is not a discrepancy. For example, Jon Smith instead of John Smith, or a missing or slightly different spelling of a middle name.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">Obliged entities can advise the company to contact us to correct these minor errors.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">If a beneficial owner’s correspondence address is different from the service address on the PSC register</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">The address shown for a PSC on Companies House records is a service address - this does not have to be their home address. Obliged entities should take this into consideration.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">PSCs must provide their home address to Companies House, but it’s kept on a private register. It’s only available on request to credit reference agencies and specified public authorities.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">As the PSC’s home address is not available on the public register, it might not be a discrepancy if it does not match the address given to an obliged entity. If the address a client has provided is different to what is shown on
        the register, you may wish to check with them if they have used an alternative to their home address as a service address.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">You should only make a report when there is a clear discrepancy between the same types of address.</p>

      <h3 id="when-to-make-a-discrepancy-report" class="govuk-heading-m">When to make a discrepancy report</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">Obliged entities must make a report if they find a discrepancy when setting up a new business relationship with a customer.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You should report a discrepancy as soon as possible. Bulk reporting is not allowed. Obliged entities must not wait to make reports in bulk as this means the PSC register will not be up to date.</p>

      <h3 id="start" class="govuk-heading-m">Make a discrepancy report</h3>
      <p class="govuk-body">To report a discrepancy, you'll need:</p>
      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the company number of the entity being reported as having a discrepancy</li>
        <li>the type of discrepancy</li>
        <li>the information on the PSC register you believe is incorrect, for example an incorrect address or an error in the nature of control</li>
        <li>the correct information as you believe it should be shown on the register</li>
        <li>any other relevant information about the discrepancy that supports the report</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reporting a discrepancy takes up to 10 minutes.

      <p class="govuk-body">We’ll check our records and if we find that the reported discrepancy needs to be corrected, we’ll contact the company and ask that they resolve it to make sure the PSC register is up to date. If the discrepancy is not resolved
        by the company, we may remove the incorrect information from the register.</p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We'll email the obliged entity to let them know the outcome of our investigation.</p>
