      <p class="govuk-body">A discrepancy is when the information that an obliged entity holds about a beneficial owner clearly shows that the information recorded by Companies House, in terms of the definition of a PSC, is incorrect.</p>

       <p class="govuk-body">A discrepancy exists when a relevant entity has information that clearly indicates that the PSC information recorded by Companies House is inaccurate.</p>

       <p class="govuk-body">This could include a discrepancy with a:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>person listed as a PSC</li>
  <li>missing PSC</li>
  <li>PSC exemption</li>
  <li>PSC type</li>
  <li>address</li>
  <li>place of registration</li>
  <li>date of birth</li>
  <li>nationality</li>
  <li>legal form</li>
  <li>company statement</li>
</ul>
  <p class="govuk-body">Our focus is on factual errors, such as a missing PSC or an incorrect service address, not typing mistakes. It is not a discrepancy when the entity holds information that we do not include on the PSC register. </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">A spelling error is not a discrepancy. For example, Jon Smith instead of John Smith, or a missing or slightly different spelling of a middle name.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Obliged entities can advise the company to contact us to correct these minor errors.</p>

<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">If a beneficial owner’s correspondence address is different from the service address on the PSC register</p>

<p class="govuk-body">The address shown for a PSC on Companies House records is a service address - this does not have to be their home address. Obliged entities should take this into consideration.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">PSCs must provide their home address to Companies House, but it’s kept on a private register. It’s only available on request to credit reference agencies and specified public authorities.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">As the PSC’s home address is not available on the public register, it might not be a discrepancy if it does not match the address given to an obliged entity. If the address a client has provided is different to what is shown on the register, you may wish to check with them if they have used an alternative to their home address as a service address.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You should only make a report when there is a clear discrepancy between the same types of address.</p>
