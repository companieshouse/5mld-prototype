      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>
      <p class="govuk-body">We'll investigate the discrepancy, which could take some time. We will not tell the company who has reported a discrepancy about their PSC register information.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">If we find that the reported discrepancy needs to be corrected, weâ€™ll contact the company and ask that they resolve it to make sure the PSC register is up to date. If the discrepancy is not resolved by the company, we may remove
        the incorrect information from the register.
      </p>
      <p class="govuk-body">We'll email you to let you know the outcome of our investigation.
      </p>
